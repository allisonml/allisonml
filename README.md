### Howdy! 🤠

I'm Allison, an upcoming BSc in Computer Science grad at UBC and this is the place some of my code calls home. Happy to have you here:)

Be sure to also check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/allisonmluna/) to learn about some of my other academic and work projects and other fun stuff I'm up to.

A bit about me...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about how we implement distributed systems and how we can keep our computer systems secure. I think I'm really growing to like Capture the Flag challenges...
- 💬 Ask me about why I will never skip out on the midnight hackathon karaoke at the slight risk of not having a voice to pitch our product the next morning (don't worry, I never actually lose it)
- 🍪 Fun fact: Aside from learning new things, greeting new challenges, and getting to know my coworkers, one of the biggest things I will always look forward to in working after graduation is having a reliable source of snacks right beside me at my desk at all times.
- 📫 How to reach me: Feel free to message me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/allisonmluna/) or send me an email at allisonmluna@gmail.com
